# laravel-api

- i got laravel to work with react while practicing in a different file but it's not working now...lol
- now showing 'Hello World!' locally!!!!
- showed hello world, but the react app wouldn't change when I edited it. Would give an elifecycle error with permission denied when running 'npm run watch'. Problem fixed with 'npm rebuild' (thanks to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54831494/sh-1-cross-env-permission-denied-on-laravel-mix)
- deleted 10,000 lines of css in /public/css/app.css
- restaring as i was having issues migrating due to php.ini permissions. with mamp, there were like 100 php.ini files. restarting project with xampp.
